# E-Commerce-Backend Project

## Description

This project was built Understand CRUD requests using Sequelize and MySQL. This projects allows the creation of a mock e-commerce MySQL database to test CRUD requests using Sequelize libraries via the Insomnia application.

During the development of this project, one of the things I learned was how to create CRUD routes, connect to a database and execute requests against that database. Another concept learned in this project was the concept of table associations in databases.

## Installation

First make sure you have created the database. Then enter "npm run seed" to seed the database with 'dummy' data. Then launch the server via "node server.js". The application is now ready to route your CRUD requests!

## Usage

Once you have started the server, you can use a tool such as Insomnia to test requests via connection to the localhost.
